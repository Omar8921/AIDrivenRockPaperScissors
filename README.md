# AI-Driven Rock Paper Scissors using Markov Chains

This project implements an AI-driven Rock Paper Scissors game using Markov Chains. The AI learns and predicts the player's next move based on previous rounds.

## Features
- AI-driven gameplay using Markov Chains.
- Three implementations:
  - **Procedural**
  - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
  - **Event-Driven**

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the repository**:
   Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash

   cd AIDrivenRockPaperScissors

2. **Compile the Java files**:
   In the terminal, run:
   ```bash
   javac *.java

3. **Run each version**:
   After compiling, run any of the following game versions:
   ```bash
   java EventDrivenRockPaperScissors
   java OOPRockPaperScissors
   java ProceduralRockPaperScissors
